# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:

# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
#       with:
#         cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}

# 💁 The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ℹ️ Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with '🖊️' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Ensure that your repository contains the necessary configuration for your Tencent Kubernetes Engine cluster, 
#    including deployment.yml, kustomization.yml, service.yml, etc.
#
# 2. Set up secrets in your workspace: 
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_ID with Tencent Cloud secret id
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY with Tencent Cloud secret key 
#    - TENCENT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID with Tencent Cloud account id
#    - TKE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD with TKE registry password
#
# 3. Change the values for the TKE_IMAGE_URL, TKE_REGION, TKE_CLUSTER_ID and DEPLOYMENT_NAME environment variables (below).

# This workflow installs the latest version of Terraform CLI and configures the Terraform CLI configuration file
# with an API token for Terraform Cloud (app.terraform.io). On pull request events, this workflow will run
# `terraform init`, `terraform fmt`, and `terraform plan` (speculative plan via Terraform Cloud). On push events
# to the master branch, `terraform apply` will be executed.
#
# Documentation for `hashicorp/setup-terraform` is located here: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following setup steps.
#
# 1. Create a `main.tf` file in the root of this repository with the `remote` backend and one or more resources defined.
#   Example `main.tf`:
#     # The configuration for the `remote` backend.
#     terraform {
#       backend "remote" {
#         # The name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
#         organization = "example-organization"
#
#         # The name of the Terraform Cloud workspace to store Terraform state files in.
#         workspaces {
#           name = "example-workspace"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
#     # An example resource that does nothing.
#     resource "null_resource" "example" {
#       triggers = {
#         value = "A example resource that does nothing!"
#       }
#     }
#
#
# 2. Generate a Terraform Cloud user API token and store it as a GitHub secret (e.g. TF_API_TOKEN) on this repository.
#   Documentation:
#     - https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/users-teams-organizations/api-tokens.html
#     - https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
#
# 3. Reference the GitHub secret in step using the `hashicorp/setup-terraform` GitHub Action.
#   Example:
#     - name: Setup Terraform
#       uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
#       with:
#         cli_config_credentials_token: ${{ secrets.TF_API_TOKEN }}
